# Temperature Converter React App

This is a simple React application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The app dynamically updates the converted values as users input temperatures.

## Features

- Convert temperatures between **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**.
- Real-time conversion â€” changing one value automatically updates the other two.
- Simple, clean UI with responsive design.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/temperature-converter-react.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd temperature-converter-react
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the app in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.
